Nomisma.org is an international, collaborative project to provide stable digital representations of numismatic concepts according to the principles of [Linked Open Data](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) (LOD). These take the form of HTTP URIs that also provide access to reusable information about those concepts, along with links to other resources. The Nomisma.org community maintains a formalized [RDF Ontology](http://nomisma.org/ontology) and a data model for encoding concepts, coins, typologies, hoards, and other types of numismatic objects as LOD.

The information made available by Nomisma.org has been provided by a wide community of scholars and institutions. All concepts published by Nomisma.org domain are openly accessible with a CC-BY license. See the [Datasets]({{site.baseurl}}/datasets) page for further license statements for partner contributions to the Nomisma.org LOD ecosystem.
