Nomisma.org is an international, collaborative project to provide stable digital representations of numismatic concepts according to the principles of [Linked Open Data](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html) (LOD). These take the form of HTTP URIs that also provide access to reusable information about those concepts, along with links to other resources. The Nomisma.org community maintains a formalized [RDF Ontology](http://nomisma.org/ontology) and a data model for encoding concepts, coins, typologies, hoards, and other types of numismatic objects as LOD.

Since 2010, the nomisma.org project has been hosted and financially supported by the American Numismatic Society in New York. It was founded by Andrew Meadows, then deputy director of the Society, and Sebastian Heath, its data scientist. The current Principal Developer of the Nomisma project is Ethan Gruber, Director of Data Science at the ANS.

The information made available by Nomisma.org has been provided by a wide community of scholars and institutions. All concepts published by Nomisma.org domain are openly accessible with a CC-BY license. See the [Datasets]({{site.baseurl}}/datasets) page for further license statements for partner contributions to the Nomisma.org LOD ecosystem.

If you would like to support the work of the ANS and the wider numismatic community in maintaining this resource for future generations, please consider making a donation to the ANS by visiting [https://numismatics.org/giving/](https://numismatics.org/giving/).
